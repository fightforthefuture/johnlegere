# JOHN LEGERE IS A BULLY.

During a twitter Q&A, our friends at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) [asked John Legere](https://twitter.com/EFF/status/685199019161726976) whether T-Mobile's BingeOn program throttles videos, pointing to [recent testing data](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/eff-confirms-t-mobiles-bingeon-optimization-just-throttling-applies) that suggest the company is violating FCC net neutrality rules. Legere's [response](https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/685201130427531264) was an over the top attack: “Who the fuck are you, EFF? Why are you stirring up so much trouble? And who pays you?”

The thing is, EFF is right. Since throttled videos are broken for viewers, Legere's policy censors the work of hundreds of millions of creators.

**Video makers shouldn't have to register with every ISP in the world, just to avoid censorship!**
