# JOHN LEGERE IS A BULLY.

During a twitter Q&A, our friends at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) [asked John Legere](https://twitter.com/EFF/status/685199019161726976) about whether T-Mobile's BingeOn program throttles videos for all customers, pointing to [recent testing data](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/eff-confirms-t-mobiles-bingeon-optimization-just-throttling-applies) that suggest the company is violating net neutrality rules. Legere's [response](https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/685201130427531264) was an over the top attack on EFF: “Who the fuck are you, EFF? Why are you stirring up so much trouble? And who pays you?”

EFF is right, though: throttled videos are simply broken for viewers. Legere is censoring the voices of hundreds of millions of online videomakers, and privileging those who participate in BingeOn. Creators shouldn't have to register with T-Mobile just to avoid censorship!
