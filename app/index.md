# JOHN LEGERE IS A BULLY.

During a twitter Q&A, our friends at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) [asked John Legere](https://twitter.com/EFF/status/685199019161726976) about whether T-Mobile's BingeOn program throttles videos for all customers, pointing to [recent testing data](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/eff-confirms-t-mobiles-bingeon-optimization-just-throttling-applies) suggesting that the company may be violating net neutrality rules. Legere's [response](https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/685201130427531264) was an over the top attack on EFF: “Who the fuck are you, EFF? Why are you stirring up so much trouble? And who pays you?”

**John Legere is attacking net neutrality and the civil advocacy groups trying to defend it. Help us teach him a lesson!**
